The notes are searchable, can be copied, tagged and modified either from the application directly or from your own text editor. The notes are in [Markdown format](https://joplinapp.org/help/apps/markdown). Joplin is available as a **desktop**, **mobile** and **terminal** application.\n\nThe notes in this notebook give an overview of what Joplin can do and how to use it. In general, the three applications share roughly the same functionalities; any differences will be clearly indicated.\n\n![](:/1c789b027aaa4bed9334ac5f630e0756)\n\n## Joplin is divided into three parts\n\nJoplin has three main columns:\n\n- **Sidebar** contains the list of your notebooks and tags, as well as the synchronisation status.\n\n- **Note List** contains the current list of notes - either the notes in the currently selected notebook, the notes in the currently selected tag, or search results.\n\n- **Note Editor** is the place where you write your notes. There is a **Rich Text editor** and a **Markdown editor** - click on the **Toggle editor** button in the top right hand corner to switch between both! You may also use an [external editor](https://joplinapp.org/help/apps/external_text_editor) to edit notes. For example you can use Typora as an external editor and it will display the note as well as any embedded images.\n\n## Writing notes in Markdown\n\nMarkdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. Joplin supports a [Github-flavoured Markdown syntax](https://joplinapp.org/help/apps/markdown) with a few variations and additions.\n\nIn general, while Markdown is a markup language, it is meant to be human readable, even without being rendered. This is a simple example (you can see how it looks in the viewer panel):\n\n* * *\n\n# Heading\n\n## Sub-heading\n\nParagraphs are separated by a blank line. Text attributes _italic_, **bold** and `monospace` are supported. You can create bullet lists:\n\n* apples\n* oranges\n* pears\n\nOr numbered lists:\n\n1. wash\n2. rinse\n3. repeat\n\nThis is a [link](https://joplinapp.org) and, finally, below is a horizontal rule:\n\n* * *\n\nA lot more is possible including adding code samples, math formulae or checkbox lists - see the [Markdown documentation](https://joplinapp.org/help/apps/markdown) for more information.\n\n## Organising your notes\n\n### With notebooks\n\nJoplin notes are organised into a tree of notebooks and sub-notebooks.\n\n- On **desktop**, you can create a notebook by clicking on New Notebook, then you can drag and drop them into other notebooks to organise them as you wish.\n- On **mobile**, press the \"+\" icon and select \"New notebook\".\n- On **terminal**, press `:mn`\n\n![](:/5ad8d7851b694d238d45e871d32cdac8)\n\n### With tags\n\nThe second way to organise your notes is using tags:\n\n- On **desktop**, right-click on any note in the Note List, and select \"Edit tags\". You can then add the tags, separating them by commas.\n- On **mobile**, open the note and press the \"⋮\" button and select \"Tags\".\n- On **terminal**, type `:help tag` for the available commands.\n","url":"1.-welcome-to-joplin!","title":"1.

The supported cloud services are the following:\n\n## Setting up Joplin Cloud synchronisation\n\n[Joplin Cloud](https://joplinapp.org/plans/) is a web service specifically designed for Joplin. Besides synchronising your data, it also allows you to publish a note to the internet, or share a notebook with your friends, family or colleagues. Joplin Cloud, compared to other services, also features a number of performance improvements allowing for faster synchronisation.\n\nTo use it, go to the config screen, then to the Synchronisation section. In the list of sync targets, select \"Joplin Cloud\". Enter your email and password, and you're ready to use Joplin Cloud.\n\n## Setting up Dropbox synchronisation\n\nSelect \"Dropbox\" as the synchronisation target in the config screen. Then, to initiate the synchronisation process, click on the \"Synchronise\" button in the sidebar and follow the instructions.\n\n## Setting up Nextcloud synchronisation\n\nNextcloud is a self-hosted, private cloud solution. To set it up, go to the config screen and select Nextcloud as the synchronisation target. Then input the WebDAV URL (to get it, go to your Nextcloud page, click on Settings in the bottom left corner of the page and copy the URL). Note that it has to be the **full URL**, so for example if you want the notes to be under `/Joplin`, the URL would be something like `https://example.com/remote.php/webdav/Joplin` (note that \"/Joplin\" part). And **make sure to create the \"/Joplin\" directory in Nextcloud**. Finally set the username and password. If it does not work, please [see this explanation](https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/issues/61#issuecomment-373282608) for more details.\n\n## Setting up OneDrive or WebDAV synchronisation\n\nOneDrive and WebDAV are also supported as synchronisation services. Please see [the synchronisation documentation](https://joplinapp.org/help/apps/sync/) for more information.\n\n## Using End-To-End Encryption\n\nJoplin supports end-to-end encryption (E2EE) on all the applications. E2EE is a system where only the owner of the data can read it. It prevents potential eavesdroppers - including telecom providers, internet providers, and even the developers of Joplin from being able to access the data. Please see the [End-To-End Encryption Tutorial](https://joplinapp.org/help/apps/sync/e2ee) for more information about this feature and how to enable it.\n","url":"3.-synchronising-your-notes","title":"3.
